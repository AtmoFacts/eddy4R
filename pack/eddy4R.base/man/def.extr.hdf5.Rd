\title{Definition function: Extract data and attributes from HDF5 input file to another HDF5 output file}
\usage{
def.extr.hdf5(FileIn = NULL, rpt = NULL, FileOut = NULL,
  MethExtrData = TRUE, MethExtrAttr = TRUE, dp01 = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{FileIn}{is the input HDF5 file (turb or stor) the data and metadata are being read from. It is ignored if \code{rpt} is specified.}

\item{rpt}{is the list returned from a previous call of \code{eddy4R.base::def.extr.hdf5()} with \code{FileIn} specified. At a minimum the entries \code{rpt$listGrpName}, \code{rpt$listData} and \code{rpt$listAttr} are required to write the contents to an output hdf5 file.}

\item{FileOut}{is the output file nsae HDF5 written to.}

\item{MethExtrData}{logical parameter that decides if data from the input file should be extracted and written to the output file.}

\item{MethExtrAttr}{logical parameter that decides if attributes (metadata) from the input file should be extracted and written to the output file.}

\item{dp01}{A vector of class "character" containing the name of NEON dp01 which data from the input file are not extracted and written to the output file}
}
\value{
A NEON formatted HDF5 file that has parameters from the input file written to the output HDF5 file.
}
\description{
Definition function. Function extracts group sturcture, data, and metadata attributes from input, examples include ecte (turbulent/turb) and ecse (storage/stor) HDF5 files to a another HDF5 file, used for nsae (net surface atmosphere exchange), with the same group heirarchy structure from each file. Either \code{FileIn} or \code{rpt} must be specified for \code{eddy4R.base::def.extr.hdf5()} to work. If \code{FileIn} is specified, the contents of the specified file are read (and optionally written to an output file). If \code{rpt} is specified, its contents are being written to an output file. This enables to read hdf5 files (call \code{eddy4R.base::def.extr.hdf5()} and specify \code{FileIn}), then modify the resulting \code{rpt} object as needed, and lastly to write the modified \code{rpt} object to file (call \code{eddy4R.base::def.extr.hdf5()} and specify \code{rpt}).
