\title{Definition function: Create the ECTE HDF5 file structure}
\usage{
def.hdf5.crte(Date, Site = "SERC", LevlTowr, DirOut, Dom = Dom,
  MethExpd = TRUE, fileNameReadMe = NULL, fileNameObjDesc = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{Date}{is the date for the output file being generated.}

\item{Site}{is the site for which the output file is being generated.}

\item{LevlTowr}{is the measurement level of the tower top to determine the VER number of the NEON DP naming convention.}

\item{DirOut}{is the output directory where the file being generated is stored.}

\item{Dom}{is the NEON domain}

\item{MethExpd}{logical indicating if the output should be expanded or basic}

\item{fileNameReadMe}{character indicating the filename incl. absolute path to the ReadMe file for inclusion in the output HDF5 file. Defaults to \code{NULL}, which downloads the readme file from a web location.}

\item{fileNameObjDesc}{character indicating the filename incl. absolute path to the object description file for inclusion in the output HDF5 file. Defaults to \code{NULL}, which downloads the object description file from a web location.}
}
\value{
A NEON formatted HDF5 file that is output to /code{DirOut} with a readme and object description included.
}
\description{
Definition function. Function creates the standard NEON HDF5 file structure for the ECTE data products.
